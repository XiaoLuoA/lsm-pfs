# KingFsSystem

In this project I am triying to implement a simple UNIX-like file system simulator in order
to understand the hierarchical directory and inode structures. By this program will be able to
browse the disk information, file and directory list, create and delete files and
directories, read and write files. The functionality of the file system is similar to
UNIX file systems, but it does not include per-process open file table, permission and
user management.
